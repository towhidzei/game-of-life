# Game of Life in Rust just for fun

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in Rust. This project provides an interactive simulation of cellular automata using a grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead. The grid evolves over time based on a set of rules.

Ensure that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-of-life-rust.git
   cd game-of-life-rust
   cargo run 
   #or
   cargo run -- random
